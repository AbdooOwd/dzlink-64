This is my first attempt at making a 3D game for the Nintendo 64 using
[libdragon](https://libdragon.dev/) and [Tiny3D](https://github.com/HailToDodongo/Tiny3D).

## How to build

You'll require [libdragon](https://libdragon.dev/) for an N64 library/interface
and [Tiny3D](https://github.com/HailToDodongo/Tiny3D) for a nice microcode
to handle 3D stuff (I still don't quite understand all of that yet).

The [`Makefile`](./Makefile) is the file that is used to manipulate
the project (build, clean, run...) using [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
(see it as... build automation? like a bash script but better).
