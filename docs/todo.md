# Todos

- Implement an actor system (heavily inspired from HackerOoT)
- Learn how to display a 3D plane with Tiny3D
- Learn how to display a 3D model
- Find the most efficient way to store 3D Objects:
  `.t3dm` (Tiny3D) or raw `.c` files like in ZeldaOoT.
  - If I end up choosing the second option (very improbable),
    I'll ~~definitely~~ probably would need to write my own thing
    to display 3D graphics.
- Add my `compile_flags.txt` to [`docs/`](./) for people to have correct
  includes if using clangd and maybe note some NeoVim-C stuff
  for NVim users.

- I should implement `PlayState` & `GameState` so I can handle the game loop correctly.
